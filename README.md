# WocaDB

This project benefits from several other K-V databases:
  - [LevelDB](https://github.com/google/leveldb)
  - [Google Sparsehash](https://github.com/sparsehash/sparsehash)
  - [PalDB](https://github.com/linkedin/PalDB)

While the project is still expenrimental. Whether it can be used in production remains to be seen. Any commitment is welcome!

I hope that when someone who use this program can shout out 'Woca' to express his outrage towards green *Product Manager* or anyone else in shit company. That's the reason I call it wocaDB.
